## Usage Examples

```python
# Example: Manus API Integration
import requests

API_KEY = "your_api_key"
ENDPOINT = "https://api.manus.ai/v1/chat"

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

data = {
    "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are Manus, a helpful AI assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Can you summarize this article for me?"}
    ],
    "temperature": 0.5,
    "max_tokens": 500
}

response = requests.post(ENDPOINT, headers=headers, json=data)
result = response.json()
print(result["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

## Best Practices

1. Use appropriate system prompts for different tasks
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Manage context effectively
4. Optimize token usage
5. Cache responses when appropriate
